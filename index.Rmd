# About

This book is intended to be an ever-growing repository of statistics tips and tricks for the [Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition](https://www.oslobrains.no/). I may not be able to add appropriate references everywhere, but in general the books @wood2017a and @pinheiro2000 have been particularly useful for my own understanding.

  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
